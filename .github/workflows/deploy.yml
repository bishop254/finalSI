# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: Deploy to AWS S3

# Controls when the action will run. Triggers the workflow on push or pull request
# events but only for the master branch
on:
  push:
    branches: [ development ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ development ]

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build_and_deploy:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Here we are configuring build matrix that allows you to perform certain operations on your code
    # with different software/Operating system configurations.
    # In our case, we are only running it for Node v12.*. but you can multiple entries in that array.
      

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      # As you can see below we are using matrix.node-version => it means it will execute for all possible combinations
      # provided matrix keys array(in our case only one key => node-version)
